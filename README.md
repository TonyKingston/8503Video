# 8503Video
The 8503 Video shows me playing the physics course and the maze level.
The AI showcase video presents the maze from a birds eye view, and draws the path that the AI calculates and any rays it fires out. Its purpose is to demonstarte the AI behaving correctly, successfully generating and following paths to the player and various bonuses, instead of me playing.
